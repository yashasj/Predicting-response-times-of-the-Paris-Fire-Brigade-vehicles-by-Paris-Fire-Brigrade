# Predicting-response-times-of-the-Paris-Fire-Brigade-vehicles-by-Paris-Fire-Brigrade

## The response time is one of the most important factors for emergency services because their ability to save lives and rescue people depends on it.
## A non-optimal choice of an emergency vehicle for a rescue request may lengthen the arrival time of the rescuers and impact the future of the victim. This choice is therefore highly critical for emergency services and directly relies on their ability to predict precisely the arrival time of the different units available.
